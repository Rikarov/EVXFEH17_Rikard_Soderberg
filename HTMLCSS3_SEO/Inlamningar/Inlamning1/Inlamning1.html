                    <p>Player versus Environment (usually abbreviated as PvE) refers to the combat and activities in the game
                        which are not focused on competing against other players to succeed. PvE content is designed to be
                        completed cooperatively with other players or as a solo player, so if combat is involved it is against
                        computer controlled enemies. PvE is the opposite of Player versus Player (PvP) which focuses on combat
                        against other players. In Guild Wars 2, PvP and PvE content are completely separate; a character
                        playing PvE cannot be killed by another player.

                    <p>World versus World (also known as WvW) is a Player versus Player game mode where players from three different
                        servers, or worlds, battle in the Mists. It features open-world combat on five large maps with up
                        to several hundreds of players per map. In World versus World, players can besiege objectives such
                        as Keeps and Towers with siege weapons, and battle over resources, to win rewards for their world
                        and World Experience for themselves.
