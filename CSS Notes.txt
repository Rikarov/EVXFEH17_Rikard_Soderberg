--CSS Notes--

*{
        box-sizing: border-box;  /* Represents a universal selection for the entire document. 
        Border-box makes it so that it counts for both the size of the content, but also of the padding and border and thickness.*/

}

*{
    margin:0;
    padding:0; //These makes it so that all web browsers see the site the same as it overrides their defaults. 
}

All these are no longer needed so long I link the Normalize.css file properly as the first link in a HTML document.
